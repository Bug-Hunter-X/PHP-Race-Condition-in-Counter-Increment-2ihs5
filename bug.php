This code suffers from a race condition.  If two requests happen concurrently, `$counter` might not be incremented correctly, leading to inaccurate results. Consider the scenario where two requests hit the increment function almost simultaneously. Both requests might read the same value of `$counter`, increment it in memory, and then write the updated value back. This results in only one increment, instead of two, being applied to the shared counter.  This is a classic example of a race condition in a shared resource.

```php
<?php
$counter = 0;

function incrementCounter() {
  global $counter;
  $counter++;
}

// Simulate two concurrent requests
incrementCounter();
incrementCounter();
echo "Counter value: " . $counter; // Might output 1 instead of 2
?>
```
