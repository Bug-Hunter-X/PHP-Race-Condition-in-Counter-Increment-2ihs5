This improved code uses a mutex lock (using `flock`) to ensure that only one request can access and modify the counter at a time, eliminating the race condition.

```php
<?php
$counterFile = 'counter.txt';
$counter = 0;

function incrementCounter() {
  global $counterFile;
  $fp = fopen($counterFile, 'c+'); // Open the file for reading and writing, create if it doesn't exist
  if (flock($fp, LOCK_EX)) { // Acquire an exclusive lock
    $counter = (int)fread($fp, 1024);
    $counter++;
    ftruncate($fp, 0); // clear the file
    fwrite($fp, $counter);
    flock($fp, LOCK_UN); // Release the lock
  }
  fclose($fp);
}

// Simulate two concurrent requests
incrementCounter();
incrementCounter();
echo "Counter value: " . file_get_contents($counterFile);
?>
```

This version ensures that the counter is accurately incremented even under concurrent requests by properly serializing access to the shared resource using a file lock.
